# Mission Brief: ML Prediction & Deployment
**Episode 32** | Operation MOONLIGHT â€” Season 8 **FINALE**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective

**PRIMARY GOAL:** Deploy trained neural network (Episode 31) for real-time attack prediction. Achieve >95% block rate on live traffic.

**CONTEXT:**  
Final day. 100 live traffic samples. Enemy may attempt adversarial attacks. Success = system secure. Failure = enemy breakthrough.

**YOUR TASK:**  
Load trained model, process live traffic, block threats in real-time (<1ms per prediction).

**DELIVERABLE:**  
Production-ready AI system with >95% block rate. **Mission success = Season 8 complete.**

## ðŸ“‹ Technical Requirements

### 1. Model Loading

Load pre-trained weights from Episode 31:
```c
NeuralNetwork* nn = create_network_for_inference(3, 5, 1);
load_trained_weights(nn, "trained_weights.bin");
```

### 2. Real-Time Inference

```c
PredictionResult make_prediction(NeuralNetwork *nn, double *features, int actual_class) {
    // Normalize features
    double normalized[3] = {
        features[0] / 10000.0,  // bytes
        features[1] / 300.0,    // packets
        features[2] / 100.0     // response_time
    };
    
    // Inference
    double confidence = predict(nn, normalized);
    
    // Threat assessment
    result.predicted_class = confidence > 0.5 ? 1 : 0;
    result.threat_score = confidence * 100.0;
    result.should_block = confidence > 0.7 ? 1 : 0;  // 70% threshold
    
    return result;
}
```

### 3. Performance Metrics

Track: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, block rate, inference time.

### 4. Success Criteria

âœ… Block rate > 95%  
âœ… Inference time < 1ms  
âœ… Accuracy > 95%  
âœ… False positives < 5%
