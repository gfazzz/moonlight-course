# Mission Brief: Inter-Process Communication
## Episode 27 ‚Äî Network Silence Mode

---

## üéØ Objective

**CRITICAL:** Shutdown all network activity after Episode 26 discovery.  
**MISSION:** Establish covert IPC channels for process communication WITHOUT network.  
**CHALLENGE:** Zero network packets (enemy monitoring must see NOTHING).  
**DEADLINE:** 8.5 hours until deep scan (Dec 25, 03:00)

---

## üìã Mission Requirements

### 1. Anonymous Pipes
- ‚úÖ Create pipe pairs (parent-child communication)
- ‚úÖ Bidirectional pipes (2 pipes for request-response)
- ‚úÖ File descriptor management (close unused ends)
- ‚úÖ Handle pipe capacity (65KB Linux default)
- ‚úÖ Blocking behavior (PIPE_BUF atomicity)

### 2. Named Pipes (FIFOs)
- ‚úÖ Create FIFOs in filesystem (mkfifo)
- ‚úÖ Multi-process communication (any process can access)
- ‚úÖ Stealth FIFOs (Linux: /dev/shm/, macOS/BSD: /tmp/ + random names)
- ‚úÖ Auto-deletion after use (no traces)
- ‚úÖ Permissions (0600, owner-only)

### 3. Shared Memory
- ‚úÖ POSIX shared memory (shm_open, mmap)
- ‚úÖ Large datasets (50 MB real-time activity log)
- ‚úÖ Process-shared mutex (PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED)
- ‚úÖ Race condition prevention (mutex synchronization)
- ‚úÖ Memory-mapped I/O (direct access, no copying)

### 4. Message Queues
- ‚úÖ POSIX message queues (mq_open, mq_send, mq_receive)
- ‚úÖ Structured messages (IntelligenceMessage struct)
- ‚úÖ Priority-based delivery (critical messages first)
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking I/O (O_NONBLOCK, mq_timedreceive)
- ‚úÖ Asynchronous notification (SIGEV_SIGNAL)

### 5. Signals
- ‚úÖ Standard signals (SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2)
- ‚úÖ Realtime signals (SIGRTMIN-SIGRTMAX)
- ‚úÖ Signal payload (sival_int, sival_ptr)
- ‚úÖ Covert encoding (bit sequences via signal types)
- ‚úÖ Signal queuing (realtime signals queued, standard not)

### 6. Performance Analysis
- ‚úÖ Throughput comparison (pipes vs shared memory vs network)
- ‚úÖ Latency measurement (sub-millisecond IPC)
- ‚úÖ Covert channel bandwidth (signals: ~20 bytes/sec)
- ‚úÖ Trade-offs (speed vs stealth vs complexity)

## üß™ Testing Criteria

### Pipe Tests
```bash
# Anonymous pipe (parent-child)
./ipc_test --pipe-anonymous

# Named pipe (FIFO)
./ipc_test --pipe-named /tmp/test_fifo

# Bidirectional pipes
./ipc_test --pipe-bidirectional

# Pipe capacity test (blocking)
./ipc_test --pipe-capacity 100000  # 100 KB write (should block at 65 KB)
```

### Shared Memory Tests
```bash
# Create shared memory
./ipc_test --shm-create /moonlight_test 1048576  # 1 MB

# Attach multiple processes
./ipc_test --shm-attach /moonlight_test &  # Process 1
./ipc_test --shm-attach /moonlight_test &  # Process 2

# Race condition test (without mutex - should corrupt)
./ipc_test --shm-race-unsafe

# Mutex synchronization (with mutex - should work)
./ipc_test --shm-race-safe
```

### Message Queue Tests
```bash
# Create message queue
./ipc_test --mq-create /test_queue

# Priority test (send low prio, then high prio)
./ipc_test --mq-send /test_queue "Low priority" 1
./ipc_test --mq-send /test_queue "HIGH PRIORITY" 9
./ipc_test --mq-receive /test_queue  # Should receive HIGH PRIORITY first

# Non-blocking receive (empty queue)
./ipc_test --mq-receive-nonblock /test_queue  # Should return EAGAIN immediately
```

### Signal Tests
```bash
# Basic signals
./ipc_test --signal-basic <PID>  # Send SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2

# Realtime signals with payload
./ipc_test --signal-rtmin <PID> 4789  # Send SIGRTMIN with value 4789

# Signal encoding (send string via bit sequence)
./ipc_test --signal-encode <PID> "ALERT"  # 40 signals (5 bytes √ó 8 bits)
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Pipe throughput
time ./ipc_test --perf-pipe 52428800  # 50 MB transfer
# Expected: ~19.5 MB/s

# Shared memory throughput
time ./ipc_test --perf-shm 52428800  # 50 MB transfer
# Expected: ~561.8 MB/s (28.8x faster)

# Signal bandwidth
time ./ipc_test --perf-signal 1000  # 1000 bytes via signals
# Expected: ~50 seconds (~20 bytes/sec)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Mission Status

All network activity shut down. IPC channels operational.  
Enemy network monitoring: sees NOTHING.

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
- New enemy process: tracker2 (PID 4789) - upgraded surveillance tool
- Activity: /etc/passwd access, port scanning, ptrace attempts, data exfiltration
- Deep scan countdown: 5.5 hours remaining (Dec 25, 03:00)

**URGENT:** Proceed to Episode 28 immediately.  
Stealth operation required. Timing attacks. Final confrontation.
