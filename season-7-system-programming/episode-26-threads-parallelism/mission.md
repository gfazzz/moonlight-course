# Mission Brief: Threads & Parallelism
## Episode 26 — Race Against Time

---

## 🎯 Objective

**URGENT:** Analyze 324 captured enemy packets using parallel processing.  
**CHALLENGE:** Single-threaded = 32 minutes. Multi-threaded (8 cores) = 4 minutes.  
**DEADLINE:** Find packet 047 (critical intelligence) before enemy changes tactics.  
**TIME LIMIT:** ~9 hours until enemy deep scan (Dec 25, 03:00)

## 📋 Mission Requirements

### 1. Thread Pool Creation
- ✅ Create 8 worker threads (match CPU cores)
- ✅ Thread-safe task queue (bounded buffer, capacity 50)
- ✅ Producer thread (load packets from Episode 25)
- ✅ Consumer threads (process packets in parallel)

### 2. Producer-Consumer Pattern
- ✅ Bounded buffer implementation
- ✅ Mutex protection (queue data structure)
- ✅ Condition variables (not_empty, not_full)
- ✅ Handle queue full (producer blocks)
- ✅ Handle queue empty (consumers block)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown (broadcast to all threads)

### 3. Synchronization Primitives
- ✅ pthread_mutex (protect shared memory)
- ✅ pthread_cond (signal/wait mechanism)
- ✅ Atomic operations (for counters)
- ✅ Memory barriers (ensure visibility)

### 4. Race Condition Prevention
- ✅ Identify shared variables (queue, counters, buffers)
- ✅ Protect with mutex or atomic ops
- ✅ Critical sections minimized (lock only when necessary)
- ✅ Test with thread sanitizer (no data races)

### 5. Deadlock Avoidance
- ✅ Consistent lock ordering (always A→B→C, never B→A)
- ✅ No circular wait (lock hierarchy)
- ✅ Timeout on lock acquisition (pthread_mutex_timedlock)
- ✅ Test with stress conditions (producer/consumer imbalance)

### 6. Performance Optimization
- ✅ Achieve 7-8x speedup (8 threads vs 1 thread)
- ✅ Load balancing (work distributed evenly)
- ✅ Minimize lock contention (short critical sections)
- ✅ Cache-friendly data structures

## 🧪 Testing Criteria

### Thread Pool Tests
```bash
# Create thread pool
./threads_test --create-pool 8

# Verify all threads created
ps -T -p <PID>  # Should show 9 threads (1 main + 8 workers)

# Check thread IDs (Linux)
cat /proc/<PID>/task/*/status | grep Tgid  # Linux
# macOS/FreeBSD: ps -M -p <PID> or lldb attach
```

### Producer-Consumer Tests
```bash
# Test empty queue (consumers block)
./threads_test --producer-slow --consumers-fast

# Test full queue (producer blocks)
./threads_test --producer-fast --consumers-slow

# Test balanced (steady state)
./threads_test --balanced
```

### Race Condition Tests
```bash
# Without mutex (should show data corruption)
./threads_test --no-mutex --increments 10000
# Expected: counter < 20000 (lost updates)

# With mutex (should show correct result)
./threads_test --with-mutex --increments 10000
# Expected: counter == 20000 (perfect)

# Thread sanitizer
gcc -fsanitize=thread threads.c -lpthread
./a.out
# Should report no data races
```

### Deadlock Tests
```bash
# Inconsistent lock ordering (should deadlock)
./threads_test --deadlock-demo

# Consistent lock ordering (should succeed)
./threads_test --no-deadlock
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Single-threaded baseline
time ./threads_test --threads 1 --packets 324
# Expected: ~32 seconds

# Multi-threaded (8 threads)
time ./threads_test --threads 8 --packets 324
# Expected: ~4 seconds (7-8x speedup)
```

## ⚠️ Mission Status

**ACCOMPLISHED** ✅

Parallel analysis complete. Packet 047 found: **Enemy suspects us (67% confidence)**.

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
- Deep scan scheduled: Dec 25, 03:00 (9 hours away)
- Detection probability: 85-95% if daemon still active
- Action required: Shutdown daemon, use IPC for covert communication

**URGENT:** Proceed to Episode 27 immediately.  
No time to waste. IPC covert channels needed NOW.
