[21:30:00] FINAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT
================================================================================
Mission: Parallel log analysis (Episode 26)
Duration: 3.5 hours (includes stress testing, secondary analysis)
Packets analyzed: 324 (from Episode 25 surveillance)
Parallel speedup: 7.6x (4 min vs 32 min single-threaded)

üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS:

1. **Enemy Suspects Us** (Packet 047)
   - Confidence: 67%
   - Target: moonlight_monitor process
   - Action: Deep scan requested

2. **Next Enemy Scan** (Packets 048-053)
   - Scheduled: Dec 25, 03:00 (9 hours from now at 18:00 today)
   - Type: Deep system scan (process memory, open files, network)
   - Detection probability: 85-95% if we're still active

3. **Data Exfiltrated** (67 packets)
   - Process list with moonlight_monitor (VISIBLE)
   - Network connections (our monitoring traffic detected)
   - File hashes (daemon binary analyzed)

4. **C2 Server Commands** (47 packets)
   - Continue surveillance
   - Increase scan frequency
   - Prepare for "target_elimination"

‚ö†Ô∏è **TIME REMAINING:** ~9 hours until deep scan
‚ö†Ô∏è **THREAT LEVEL:** CRITICAL
‚ö†Ô∏è **NEXT STEP:** Episode 27 (IPC) - Setup covert communication channel

**RECOMMENDATION:** 
- Shutdown moonlight_monitor daemon before next scan
- Use IPC for covert communication (no network traffic)
- Episode 27 URGENT - Covert channels needed NOW
