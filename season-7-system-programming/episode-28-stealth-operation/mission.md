# Mission Brief: Stealth Operation
## Episode 28 ‚Äî SEASON 7 FINALE

---

## üéØ Objective

**CRITICAL:** 5 hours until deep scan (Dec 25, 03:00). Final confrontation.  
**MISSION:** Extract secrets via timing/cache attacks, infiltrate C2, cancel scan.  
**CHALLENGE:** Defeat enemy at system level using advanced side-channels.  
**STAKES:** Victory (whitelisted) OR Defeat (all processes terminated)

## üìã Mission Requirements

### 1. Timing Attacks (22:00-00:00, 2 hours)
- ‚úÖ Password/key length discovery (measure response time vs length)
- ‚úÖ Character-by-character extraction (timing side-channel)
- ‚úÖ API key extraction (32 bytes: API_KEY_MOONLIGHT_TRACKER2_v2.01)
- ‚úÖ Covert timing channel setup (modulate execution time for bits)
- ‚úÖ Performance: Extract 32-byte key in < 6 minutes

### 2. Cache Side-Channels (00:00-02:30, 2.5 hours)
- ‚úÖ Flush+Reload attack (AES key schedule extraction)
- ‚úÖ Prime+Probe attack (S-box access patterns)
- ‚úÖ Evict+Time attack (denial-of-service)
- ‚úÖ Spectre Variant 1 (speculative execution leak)
- ‚úÖ Meltdown attack (kernel memory read)
- ‚úÖ Defensive detection (monitor our own cache behavior)

### 3. Final Confrontation (02:30-03:30, 1 hour)
- ‚úÖ C2 server authentication (use extracted API key)
- ‚úÖ Intelligence gathering (query deep scan details)
- ‚úÖ Cancellation attempt (submit cancel request)
- ‚úÖ Fake telemetry generation (convince supervisor)
- ‚úÖ Evasion fallback (if cancellation fails)

### 4. Secrets to Extract
- ‚úÖ API key: 32 bytes (authentication token)
- ‚úÖ AES key: 128-bit (encryption key)
- ‚úÖ C2 server: IP + port (185.220.101.42:8080)
- ‚úÖ Deep scan config: time, targets, actions
- ‚úÖ Process credentials: tracker2 ROOT status

### 5. Attack Techniques
- ‚úÖ Timing side-channel (non-constant-time comparison)
- ‚úÖ Cache timing (Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe)
- ‚úÖ Speculative execution (Spectre, Meltdown)
- ‚úÖ Covert channels (timing modulation)
- ‚úÖ Social engineering (fake telemetry)

## üß™ Testing Criteria

### Timing Attack Tests
```bash
# Key length discovery
./timing_attack --discover-length /usr/bin/tracker2
# Expected: 32 bytes

# Character extraction (first byte)
./timing_attack --extract-byte 0 /usr/bin/tracker2
# Expected: 0x41 ('A')

# Full key extraction
./timing_attack --extract-full /usr/bin/tracker2
# Expected: API_KEY_MOONLIGHT_TRACKER2_v2.01 (in ~5-6 minutes)

# Covert timing channel
./timing_attack --covert-send "EVADE" <receiver_pid>
# Expected: Receiver decodes "EVADE" (40 bits, ~2.5 seconds)
```

### Cache Side-Channel Tests
```bash
# Flush+Reload (AES key)
./cache_attack --flush-reload /usr/bin/tracker2 0x7f8a4c400000
# Expected: AES master key extracted (2b7e1516 28aed2a6 abf71588 09cf4f3c)

# Prime+Probe (cache sets)
./cache_attack --prime-probe /usr/bin/tracker2
# Expected: Cache sets #3, #5, #7, #9, #12, #15 accessed (S-box pattern)

# Spectre (speculative leak)
./cache_attack --spectre /usr/bin/tracker2 <secret_address>
# Expected: Out-of-bounds secret leaked via cache

# Meltdown (kernel memory)
./cache_attack --meltdown <kernel_address>
# Expected: Kernel memory leaked (tracker2 credentials: UID=0, ROOT)
```

### C2 Infiltration Tests
```bash
# Authentication
./c2_client --authenticate 185.220.101.42:8080 "API_KEY_MOONLIGHT_TRACKER2_v2.01"
# Expected: HTTP 200, session token returned

# Query operations
./c2_client --query-operations <session_token>
# Expected: Deep scan details (OP-2024-12-25-001, status: SCHEDULED)

# Cancel scan
./c2_client --cancel-scan OP-2024-12-25-001 <session_token>
# Expected: Status: PENDING_APPROVAL ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí CANCELLED
```

### Stealth Tests
```bash
# Verify timing attack undetected
./monitor_tracker2 --check-anomaly-detection
# Expected: Our attacks below 250 Œºs threshold (undetected)

# Verify network silence (except C2 connection)
tcpdump -i eth0 | grep -v 185.220.101.42
# Expected: ZERO other traffic

# Verify no logs
ls /tmp/moonlight_* /var/log/*moonlight*
# Expected: NO files (all wiped)
```
