The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a sample text for frequency analysis.
In English, the letter E is the most common letter, appearing approximately 12.7 percent of the time.
The letters T, A, O, I, N are also very frequent. By analyzing the frequency distribution of letters,
we can often break simple substitution ciphers like the Caesar cipher. This technique, known as
frequency analysis, was discovered by the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi in the 9th century.
It revolutionized cryptanalysis and remained one of the most powerful tools for breaking ciphers
for over a thousand years. Even today, understanding letter frequencies is fundamental to cryptography.
