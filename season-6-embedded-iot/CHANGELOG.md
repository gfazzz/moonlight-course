# CHANGELOG for Season 6: Embedded & IoT

## v2.0 Enhanced Edition (October 3, 2025)
- **Status:** PRODUCTION READY (80% complete)
- **Overview:** Major overhaul bringing all episodes to production-ready standard.
  Full solution code, comprehensive implementations, and professional documentation.

### Key Improvements:

- **Episode 21: Arduino & GPIO Fundamentals**
  - Full C solution (`arduino_gpio.c`, 620 lines) with GPIO pin simulation
  - Realistic sensor behavior: PIR motion, door contact, LM35 temperature
  - Actuator control: LED with PWM, relay, buzzer
  - Event logging system with 1000+ capacity
  - Statistics tracking and alert system
  - Detailed `README.md` and `Makefile` for solution

- **Episode 22: Industrial Protocols & Access Control**
  - Enhanced solution (`industrial_solution.c`, 499 lines)
  - Wiegand 26-bit protocol (parse, generate, validate parity)
  - Modbus RTU with CRC16 validation
  - RFID card emulator with database
  - **v2.0 NEW:** Full access control system with authentication
  - **v2.0 NEW:** Event logging and audit trail
  - **v2.0 NEW:** Brute force attack detection
  - **v2.0 NEW:** Statistics and security reporting

- **Episode 23: IP Cameras & Video Surveillance**
  - Full C solution (`ip_cameras.c`, 510 lines)
  - RTSP URL parsing and validation
  - Camera management system (8 cameras)
  - Motion detection simulation with intensity tracking
  - **Coverage analysis:** 100x100 grid mapping
  - **Blind spot detection:** Automated uncovered area identification
  - Security vulnerability analysis (default credentials, weak passwords)
  - Comprehensive statistics and reporting

- **Episode 24: IoT Integration & System Bypass (FINALE)**
  - Full C solution (`iot_integration.c`, 410 lines)
  - MQTT message simulation (pub/sub architecture)
  - Integrated security system (9 devices: doors, cameras, sensors)
  - **Event injection:** Door unlock, camera blinding, false alarms
  - **Ghost mode:** Invisible attack operations
  - **Log tampering:** Evidence removal and forensics evasion
  - **Backdoor installation:** Persistent access mechanism
  - Complete attack sequence with 5 phases

### Documentation:
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` created with detailed feature tables
- Individual `README.md` for each episode solution
- Professional `Makefile` for all episodes
- Main Season 6 `README.md` updated with v2.0 status

### Quality Metrics:
- **Total Solution Code:** ~2,039 lines
- **Total Documentation:** ~800 lines
- **Compilation:** All solutions compile cleanly with minimal warnings
- **Test Coverage:** All episodes tested and functional
- **Completeness:** 20% â†’ 80% (+300%)

### Educational Value:
- **Embedded Systems:** GPIO, sensors, actuators, interrupts, PWM
- **Industrial Protocols:** Wiegand, Modbus RTU, CRC validation
- **IoT Security:** MQTT, event injection, backdoors
- **Video Surveillance:** RTSP, coverage analysis, blind spot detection
- **Real-world Skills:** Access control bypass, IoT exploitation, security testing

## v1.0 Initial Release (Baseline)
- **Status:** Basic Structure (20% complete)
- **Overview:** Initial setup with basic READMEs, mission.md, and starter.c files.

### Features:
- Basic theoretical descriptions in READMEs
- Plot and geography outlined (Novosibirsk Akademgorodok)
- Technical tasks defined in `mission.md`
- Skeleton `starter.c` files
- Basic `test.sh` scripts (skeletons)
- Episode 22 had partial solution (261 lines, Wiegand + Modbus basics)

### Limitations:
- No complete solution files
- Minimal test data
- Incomplete documentation
- Missing advanced features (access control, coverage analysis, attack simulations)
