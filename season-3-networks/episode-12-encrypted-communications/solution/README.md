# Solution for Episode 12: Encrypted Communications

## Complete Implementation - SEASON 3 FINALE

This solution integrates packet capture, TCP stream reconstruction, and XOR decryption to intercept and decrypt encrypted communications.

## Files

- `communication_interceptor.c` ‚Äî Complete interceptor with:
  - TCP packet capture (from Episode 11)
  - Packet filtering by IP/port
  - TCP session reconstruction by sequence number
  - Frequency analysis for key detection
  - XOR decryption (from Episode 01)
  - Stream saving to files

## Features

‚úÖ Raw packet capture with filtering  
‚úÖ TCP session reconstruction  
‚úÖ Automatic packet ordering by sequence number  
‚úÖ Frequency analysis to find XOR key  
‚úÖ Stream decryption  
‚úÖ Save raw and decrypted streams  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

**Must run as root/sudo** for raw socket access!

## Compilation

```bash
gcc -o communication_interceptor communication_interceptor.c -Wall
```

## Usage

```bash
# Capture all TCP traffic
sudo ./communication_interceptor

# Filter by IP
sudo ./communication_interceptor 192.168.1.100

# Filter by IP and port
sudo ./communication_interceptor 192.168.1.100 8080
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop capture and process the stream.

## How It Works

1. **Capture Phase**: Intercepts TCP packets with optional filtering
2. **Reconstruction Phase**: Sorts packets by sequence number and concatenates payloads
3. **Analysis Phase**: Uses frequency analysis to detect XOR key
4. **Decryption Phase**: Applies XOR decryption with detected key
5. **Output Phase**: Saves both raw and decrypted streams to `artifacts/`

## Output Files

- `artifacts/stream.dat` - Raw reconstructed TCP stream
- `artifacts/decrypted.txt` - Decrypted message

## Key Concepts Integration

- **Raw Sockets** (Episode 11)
- **XOR Encryption** (Episode 01)
- **Frequency Analysis** (cryptanalysis)
- **TCP Sequence Numbers** (proper stream reconstruction)
- **qsort()** for packet ordering

## üéâ Season 3 Complete!

You've mastered network fundamentals, socket programming, packet analysis, and encrypted communications!
