# Mission 18: Trading Algorithms — Reverse Engineering

## 🎯 Objective

Reverse-engineer trading algorithms used by the organization. Implement technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD) and build a backtesting framework to expose overfitting.

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Date:** December 19, 08:30  
**Location:** Your apartment, Arbat district, Moscow  
**Status:** URGENT

V. has intercepted trading logs from the organization's system. They claim 127% annual returns. Your mission is to validate these claims through backtesting.

**Your mission:**
1. Implement technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD)
2. Recreate their 3 trading strategies
3. Build a backtesting engine
4. Expose overfitting (127% → real returns)

**Time limit:** Until 14:00 (5.5 hours)

## 📂 Files Provided

- `artifacts/strategy_logs.csv` — 47,392 trades over 6 months
- `artifacts/historical_prices.csv` — OHLCV data for backtesting
- `artifacts/algorithm_fingerprints.txt` — Strategy patterns

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Implement SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD indicators
- Generate BUY/SELL signals
- Backtest with commissions and slippage
- Calculate Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
- Expose overfitting

## 🏆 Achievement

**"Algorithm Engineer"** — Expose the 127% → 18% overfitting fraud
