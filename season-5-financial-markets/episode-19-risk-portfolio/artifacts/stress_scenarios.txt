=== RECOMMENDATION ===
Current Portfolio Risk Assessment:
- 70% crypto exposure = extreme volatility
- 3:1 leverage = 3x losses in any scenario
- Correlation 0.95 = no protection in crash
- VaR $15.6M = 31% of portfolio at risk (95% confidence)

Historical probability of these scenarios:
- Major crash (>30% loss): ~15% per decade
- Moderate crash (10-30%): ~40% per decade  
- Flash crash: ~5% per year

With current portfolio:
- Probability of >$15M loss: 5% (VaR 95%)
- Probability of total wipeout: ~2-3% annually
- Expected time to severe loss: 3-7 years

URGENT ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Reduce leverage from 3:1 to max 1.5:1
2. Reduce crypto from 70% to max 30%
3. Add uncorrelated assets (bonds, gold, commodities)
4. Implement stop-loss at -15% portfolio level
5. Increase cash reserves to 20% for opportunities
