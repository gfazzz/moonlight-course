# Mission 19: Risk & Portfolio Management

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze critical portfolio risk for $50M fund. Calculate Value at Risk (VaR), build correlation matrix, and optimize portfolio using Markowitz theory.

## 📋 Mission Briefing

**Date:** December 19, 18:45  
**Location:** Your apartment, Arbat district, Moscow  
**Status:** CRITICAL

The organization's portfolio ($50M) is at extreme risk:
- 70% in crypto (high volatility)
- Leverage 3:1 (tripled exposure = $150M)
- Correlation 0.95 (no diversification!)

V. needs professional risk analysis NOW.

**Your mission:**
1. Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) using 3 methods
2. Build correlation matrix
3. Calculate Sharpe and Sortino ratios
4. Portfolio optimization (Markowitz)
5. Stress testing (2008, 2020, Flash Crash scenarios)

**Time limit:** Until 23:30 (4 hours 45 minutes)

## 📂 Files Provided

- `artifacts/portfolio_holdings.csv` — Current positions ($50M)
- `artifacts/historical_returns.csv` — 2 years of return data
- `artifacts/stress_scenarios.txt` — Crisis scenarios
- `artifacts/correlation_matrix.dat` — Pre-calculated correlations

## ✅ Success Criteria

- VaR calculated (Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo)
- Sharpe ratio and Sortino ratio computed
- Correlation matrix analyzed
- Optimized portfolio reduces VaR by >60%
- Stress test results for 3 scenarios

## 🏆 Achievement

**"Risk Master"** — Save $50M portfolio from $15.6M VaR disaster
